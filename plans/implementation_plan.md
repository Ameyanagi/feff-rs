## Development Principles

1. **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Modular design**: Keep components loosely coupled
3. **Performance focus**: Optimize critical paths
4. **Documentation**: Document physics and implementation details
5. **Validation**: Compare with FEFF10 reference results
6. **Git workflow**: Use branching strategy for development
   - `main`: Stable, production-ready code
   - `dev`: Active development branch
   - Feature branches: Created from `dev` for specific features
7. **Quality assurance**: Enforce code quality with pre-commit hooks and CI/CD
